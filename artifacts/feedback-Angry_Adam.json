The fact that I had to re-enter my income because your system couldn't handle a simple comma is infuriating.  It's clear that whoever designed this doesn't care about their users' time or sanity. I felt completely disrespected, like they assumed I was an idiot who couldn't understand the most basic number formatting conventions. The whole thing made me want to scream.",
