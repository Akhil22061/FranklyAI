The form itself was straightforward enough, but that ridiculous error with the comma in my income?  Seriously?  Who designs a form that can't handle a simple comma in a number field?  It's insulting.  I'm only finishing this because I desperately need this card.  The whole thing felt clunky and cheap. I would much rather jump through hoops made of fire than deal with this garbage ever again.",
