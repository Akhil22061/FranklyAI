    "overall_experience_feedback": "The application process was mostly smooth, but I encountered a minor setback with the income field.  The error message for the income field was unclear; while I understand the need for numerical input, the rejection of '50,000' was frustrating.  It made me question if my other entries were correctly formatted and made me feel slightly anxious about potential further errors. Removing the comma was an easy fix, and the subsequent successful submission was reassuring. However, the usability could be improved by providing clearer guidance regarding acceptable input formats.",
