    "overall_experience_feedback": "The application process was mostly smooth and straightforward. I appreciated the clear layout and the logical flow of information.  However, the error message regarding income was extremely unhelpful and frustrating.  The system should accept various number formats, or provide clear and specific instructions on the acceptable format (e.g., 'Please enter your income as a whole number, without commas or other characters.').  While the application ultimately worked, this error introduced unnecessary friction and made me question the system's overall reliability.  A more user-friendly experience would improve confidence in the application.",
