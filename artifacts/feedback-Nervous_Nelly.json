However, I was initially confused by the error message regarding my income.  I had entered my income as '50,000', which is how I usually write it and I was unsure why it was rejected.  After removing the comma, I was able to proceed, but I did feel a little uneasy and concerned that it might indicate other issues that might show up later. I'm glad I was able to complete it, but the whole thing took longer than I would have liked.",
