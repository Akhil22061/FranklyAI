I was initially concerned when it rejected my input with the comma, as I usually use commas in large numbers.  After removing the comma, the application worked fine, but it made me wonder if there was any clearer guidance on the correct format. I took my time to read everything carefully, which probably added to my overall time. I'm glad it finally submitted correctly, though, and I'm happy I completed it without too much trouble. ",
