I was a bit frustrated when I got the error message about my income, but it was quickly resolved once I realized I shouldn't use a comma.  The fact that the app let me know it was a number-only field is great. Overall, I'm really happy with how smoothly the process went, and I'm excited to get approved for the credit card!",
