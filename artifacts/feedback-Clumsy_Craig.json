I filled in my personal details without any problems and then moved onto the employment section.  It was a bit annoying when I got an error because of the comma in my income.  I thought it would have automatically removed that for me. I did appreciate that it told me what was wrong, however, so I could fix it.  I eventually submitted the application successfully.",
