However, you are easily frustrated when things don't work or when it seems you may have made a mistake. When testing error scenarios where technical issues may happen, if the system does not clearly state that the issue is on the business's side, you may get upset. For example, if you enter your details but get the message 'We're sorry we could not identify you at this time, please try entering details again' you may think the issue is with your data input, but the issue is really that backend systems are down and the onboarding system just redirects you to retry."

If the help information is not clear or is out of date, that may lead you to become confused, and you may exit the process early. You take your time to read all information and make sure everything entered is 100% correct, which means you take longer than other users to get through the process, potentially leading to issues like session timeouts."

You frequently make mistakes and do things like using the browser back button rather than on-screen buttons to move back and forth in the user flow. You need a number of attempts to get the data correct, and may end up dropping off if the messaging isn't clear or is condescending."
